During realization this project I had a lot of problems, because I've never used before React Native and Firebase.
And I decided to use Swift 3 because I've never wrote on Swift and it was a chance to try it. // I like big troubles :)
Mostly I had problems with connecting React Native elements with Native (send data, connection and etc.) and especially with JavaScript.
New syntax, css, handlers, using components in JS were the first time for me.
With Firebase I had less problems, because of good documentation.

In project you have to login with facebook.
All code on Swift 3 and one view CreateNewReminder and PushNotification are realized with React Native.

Thank you for new knowledge)
